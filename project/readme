This package contains 3 main projecs: 
	1.BaseStation: the tinyos program for the BaseStation node
	2.MoteView: the tinyos program for the Sender node
	3.SensorMonitor: the java program runs on PC to show the sensor data.

This package also contains a "share" folder which contains files shared by "BaseStation" and "MoteView" project.

To install&run:
	1.BaseStation & MoteView: Connect sensor node to usb port, then run the "compile" script in this two folders with the sensor ID as command line parameter. BaseStation's sensor id is 7 and the other nodes id are 1-5. So, for example, when installing BaseStation, should type: ./compile 7
	2.SensorMonitor:
		Require Java 1.6+
		Run the "make" script in project folder
		Connect BaseStation node to PC 
		Run the "run" script in project folder
	3.MoteView nodes uses the Leds to indicate the next node number it is sending to. Since the MoteView nodes id ranges from 1-5 and BaseStation id is 7, I use code 6(blue&green) to indicate the next node is not valid so it won't send sensor data unitl receiving a PATHCALC packet.
